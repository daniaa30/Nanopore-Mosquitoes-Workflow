# Nanopore-Mosquitoes-Workflow

Welcome! This repository contains the scripts for my Master's thesis:

Automated analysis of nanopore sequencing of wild-caught mosquitoes in Africa with respect to: species identification, insecticide resistance and species of last blood meal.

The total number of nanopore data I worked on were 384 FASTQ files. The data were handed over to me after Basecalling with Guppy.

Although, in the end the main aim of the thesis was not realized due to barcoding errors during sequencing,  I hope that this documentation will be useful to any researcher interested in Nanopore analysis :-)
